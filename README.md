# EpiForsk

This is a first draft of a package collecting useful functions and examples 
developed for in our department of Epidemiological research. Hopefully it will 
become a collaborative effort and a source of inspiration for solutions.

If you wish to contribute you can commit directly to github or write me an email.

R script files are named first by original developer and then a descriptive name.
